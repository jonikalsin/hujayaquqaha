The former NFL host accused Favre of sending her inappropriate photos in 2010 when he was the Jets quarterback.</p><p>“If you shared this tweet, I politely request you read the last one I posted. And never call me ‘the Brett Favre Girl’ again,” <a href=#>Sterger wrote in a separate tweet</a>.</p><p>Sterger has since pursued a media career, which includes previous work at Sports Illustrated and ABC. She is also a comedian, an actress and a writer, according to her Twitter bio.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">On-field host Jenn Sterger at the New York Jets Vs New England Patriots game at The Meadowlands (Giants Stadium) on September 14, 2008 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">New York Jets quarterback Brett Favre (4) warms up before the start of a game against the Miami Dolphins at Giants Stadium on Dec. 28, 2008, in East Rutherford, New Jersey. <span class=credit>Icon Sportswire via Getty Images</span></figure><p>In other lengthy tweets, Sterger discussed how the scandal affected her reputation and career journey. She said she was <a href=#>“wrongfully cancelled,”</a> an internet trend she doesn’t believe in.</p><p>“Days like today are always tough,” <a href=#>Sterger tweeted</a>. “I want to act like my life isn’t still drastically impacted by another person’s treatment of me, but that would be a lie. To think my legacy and everything anyone knows of me.. can be summed down to the title of ‘The Brett Favre Girl,’ is not only disgusting. But disheartening</p><p>“And every time sports has a #MeToo moment, I’m always somehow the Go-To expert,” <a href=#>Sterger said</a>. “But what we haven’t addressed is this weird hero culture we have created around pro athletes that somehow grants them immunity to consequences…”</p><p>Sterger went on to share that she has<a href=#> been in therapy for years</a> since the Favre scandal.</p><p>“I believe in redemption when people have: expressed remorse. Have done the work. And have taken that work out into the world to show you they learned something from it. Brett Favre has done none of that,” <a href=#>Sterger tweeted</a>.</p><p>“I’m roadkill in his rear view.. And you all are just now discovering that awful people do awful things when there are no consequences. Welcome to the real world,” <a href=#>Sterger wrote</a> in a separate tweet.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Comedian Jennifer Sterger performs during Laugh Factory Takes Over the Main Stage at 2021 Los Angeles Comic Con at Los Angeles Convention Center on December 03, 2021. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3Jmamxfn7KvusifnKtlo6mys7PEq2ShmaNitq%2Btz6mpqKiinq61sYytnLGsXZ%2B8rLHSZp2oql2Xv6bA02admq6imnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
