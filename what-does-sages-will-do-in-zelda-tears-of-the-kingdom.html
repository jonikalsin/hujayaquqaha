You may be wondering what exactly Sage Will does for Link since the game doesn’t give you much information to go on. Here is what Sage’s Will does in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>What is the Purpose of Sage’s Will in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h2><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>As you complete each main <a href=#>Regional Phenomena Quest</a> in <a href=#>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, you will acquire the power of the Sage Companion you helped during that quest. These powers will summon the Sage’s ability, and Link can use them in other battles around Hyrule. This is where Sage’s Will comes into play and becomes extremely useful. <strong>Here is what Sage’s Will does</strong>.</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true><strong>Sage’s Will will allow the player to upgrade the Sage’s ability through a Goddess Statue</strong>. Like Light of Blessings, players must collect four Sages Will to upgrade the ability to the next level. This ability’s next level is called “Solemn Vow.”</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=63 data-injectable=false><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>How to Unlock Autobuild in Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>How to Find a Sage’s Will</h3><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>As mentioned previously, Sage’s Will is a rare item, and so far, I have only found one of these in the land of Hyrule. But I can give you a headstart and tell you that one is above the Upland Zorana Skytower. The location of this Sky Tower is shown in the image below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Image-69.jpeg><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>Take this sky tower to the skies and aim for the giant sphere-looking mechanism. It won’t be far from the point you shoot out of the Sky Tower, so you won’t need to fly far. Below is where the Sage’s Will is located on the Sky Map.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Image-70.jpeg><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>When you reach the giant sphere, you need to aim for the circle in the middle of it. The sphere is constantly rotating but slowly, so timing is essential here. If you miss the hole, fast-travel back down to the tower and give it another try!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Image-71.jpeg><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>Once inside the sphere, you can find the Sage’s Will on the bottom floor. To get to the bottom floor, stop the fan on the turning pedestal, and then a gap will open up for you to enter.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>How Many Sage’s Will are there in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom?</h3><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has <strong>20 Sage’s Will’s</strong> for players to find across Hyrule. While most of Sage’s Wills can be found in hidden spots in the sky and even in the depths, killing a Gleeok will also reward players with a Sage’s Will.</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>Finding all of these will provide an upgrade of five times for the Sage Champion ability of your choice — making them attack harder. When you upgrade a specific Sage’s ability, the <strong>attack power will increase approximately 1.3 times</strong>. It is important to remember that the four Sage’s Will only allow one upgrade of one Sage’s ability — so choose wisely and pick the Sage that best fits your playstyle.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>What Power Should You Upgrade First with Sage’s Will?</h3><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>Considering there are five Sages in Zelda<strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Tears of the Kingdom, deciding which to upgrade first can be challenging. While it is common to recommend upgrading whichever Sage’s power you use the most — not all upgrades are created equal. Yes, every Sage power will increase with each upgrade, but there is one that seems to make the most significant difference: <strong>Tulin’s “Sage of the Wind.”</strong>&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>Increasing the Wind Sage’s power first will allow you to use its power more and travel further when paragliding and exploring the world. I, for one, mainly focused on increasing my heart capacity throughout my journey, so being able to travel further with less Stamina made a massive difference in my adventure.</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=false>Now, if you are one of those players looking to increase the amount of damage output you can land upon enemies, upgrading <strong>Yunobo Sage of Fire</strong> is a good bet. This ability is the easiest to use against waves of enemies, and making it stronger will help tremendously when it comes to crowd control.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
