In his introduction before the screening, Johnnie referred to the program as a “rom-doc,” noting that it is not a game show and “is not about manufactured drama.”</p><p>“We love romantic comedies, and that combined with our work in the unscripted space, we set out to create a true-to-life romantic documentary…aka ROM DOC,” creators and executive producers exclusively told Cosmopolitan. “What makes this dating show unique is instead of going from zero to marriage, we focused on the initial stages of love and human connection mixed with real singles that are frustrated with swiping in their city, but still optimistic that their person is out there,” they continued. “Sometimes you have to outsource love to a different city!”</p><p>Swiping America is all about connecting two strangers and watching as their love (hopefully) blossoms, using dating apps to do the magic. Singles won’t be using their applications in their own, comfortable metropolitan areas; instead, they’ll be traveling across the nation. The singles are escorted to a new place for some swipes in every episode. Following their matches, the local singles get together with the individuals from the show to mingle.</p><p>They will be able to take those that they click with on a more formal date if this goes well. Instead of trying to “win,” the objective is to actually engage with the other person. They are searching for genuine connections rather than concentrating on some form of rivalry. The singles choose who, if anyone, they want to stay in touch with as they proceed from that place.</p><p>Learn more about Reagan as this article proceeds.</p><h3><strong>Reagan Baker On HBO Max’s Swiping America</strong></h3><p>Speaking with New York Post, Reagan Baker shared that the dating scene in New York City felt a lot.
