A new garden and picnic area will feature increased parking and a “learning trail.”</p><p>At Lincoln Park, the basketball courts are set for a renovation, with new play surface areas on the ball field and playgrounds. There will be new picnic tables, parking area and a reconfigured drop-off area near the Remington Boys and Girls Club.</p><p>A new fence is going to be erected near the existing community garden complete with water lines and hose connections. Lastly, there will be a new walking loop around the basketball courts near Lincoln Avenue.</p><p>In both parks, new lighting systems will be installed, all paths will be repaved and security cameras are being put in place. All lawns and foliage will be revamped and signage will be altered from “no dogs” to “dogs on leash only.”</p><p>New Rochelle Mayor Noam Bramson said that the plan is going to cost approximately $2 million per park, and will take several years to complete. He noted that both parks are eligible for federal Community Development Block Grand funding, which could help offset any cost to taxpayers.</p><p>“Good plans are very valuable, because they help us set priorities with respect to local budgets, while also putting the city in a better position to compete successfully for grants,” he said. “What’s more, these particular parks, which are located in some of New Rochelle’s most densely-populated neighborhoods, and are eligible for CDBG (Community Development Block Grant)&nbsp;funding, which is restricted to areas with certain socio-economic characteristics.”</p><p class=e-click-here-follow-btn data-testid=bottom-paragraph><a class=e-email-signup js-follow-button data-testid=article-click-here-to-subscribe href=#>Click here</a> to follow Daily Voice New Rochelle and receive free news updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmickZ65usLOopqeZpOkunC6xLBksqeioHyvsdarppyglaG5pnvPqKOirJmYwHC6xLBkq6eTnbKtuMRmmqKsqWKwsMHNnKClZZGlvbO71Z6qZqiRp7i0ec6vnKugkaq5cIGRa2pvcV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
