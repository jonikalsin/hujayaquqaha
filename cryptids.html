The wendigo is truly one of the most infamous creatures in Native American folklore — and one of the scariest cryptids on this list. Said to be a former hunter who resorted to cannibalism, the wendigo is an insatiable evil spirit wandering the Earth. According to legends, it stands at nearly 15 feet tall, but its appearance is emaciated, as it is never able to satisfy its hunger."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Rather than relying on speed and strength to catch its prey, the wendigo prefers to slowly lure its victims into the wilderness, away from civilization. It can also turn its victim into a wendigo, which will continue to spread its malevolent hunger until the end of time.</p><p>During the turn of the 20th century, the Algonquian people attributed numerous disappearances to the wendigo, believing that many of the missing had been lured away by the horrifying creature. In fact, one rough translation of wendigo is “the evil spirit that devours mankind.”</p><p>If that doesn’t send a chill up your spine, what will?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonykvtipq6Kco2R%2BcQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
