Bobby was found with a stab wound to his chest when police arrived at a petrol station in Westminster, an Orange County city, shortly before 6 o’clock, according to the police department.</p><p>He was taken to a trauma center where he died of injuries. Trent William Milsap, a parolee from Orange County, was named as the suspect by Westminster police officers.</p><p>Trent “became confrontational” when the West County SWAT Team arrived at an Anaheim apartment complex on Friday to execute an arrest warrant. A police dog was then brought in, and Milsap was ultimately shot and killed by police, according to the agency.</p><p>Police stated on Saturday that they did not know the reason behind the attack that murdered East. Milsap was initially characterized by Westminster police as a vagrant who was known to stay at hotels in Westminster as well as adjacent Garden Grove and Anaheim. In a previous press release on the attack, the suspect’s age was given as 27 and his last name was misspelled as Millsap. He was being sought for an unrelated parole breach while on parole for armed robbery, according to the police.</p><p>Westminster police said in a statement that they have recognized Bobby as a former NASCAR driver. He is from San Dimas, a city in eastern Los Angeles County, according to the Westminster department.</p><p>Early Saturday evening NASCAR released a statement acknowledging the death of one of its own.</p><p>“NASCAR is saddened to learn of the tragic death of Bobby East,” the organization that oversees stock car racing said. “We extend our deepest and heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Bobby, a true racer”.</p><h3><strong>NASCAR Driver Bobby East Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Bobby East, the NASCAR driver, had accumulated a whopping net worth of around $10 million.</p><p>He made three attempts to qualify for NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series races in 2005, but only one of them was successful. In that race, Bobby finally crashed his car. A few weeks later, Bobby raced in Memphis in the No. 46 for ST Motorsports to make his NASCAR Busch Series debut. He did well, finishing 17th.</p><p>According to racing-reference.info, a website that keeps track of NASCAR history, he competed in races in the Xfinity Series in 2005, 2007, and 2008.
