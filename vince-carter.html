On February 23, 2012, he was given praises by former U.S. President <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Barack Obama</a>, who had described Carter’s game as a “huge treat” for himself since his Tar Heels days.</li><li>He made his professional career debut in 1998 after he was drafted as the 5th overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft by Golden State Warriors. He was then traded to the Toronto Raptors as the 4th overall pick.</li><li>His rookie season was put on hold until January 1999 due to the NBA lockout. He had a solid start and eventually became a fan-favorite with his soaring offensive game which earned him the nickname “Air Canada”.</li><li>Following Carter’s rookie season, he went on to become an ultimate star player in the 2nd season during which he averaged 25.7 points per game, the fourth-highest in the league at that time.
