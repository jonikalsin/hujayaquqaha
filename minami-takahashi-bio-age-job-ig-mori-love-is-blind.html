If they take the plunge and choose to propose, only then do they get to meet face-to-face. Following this comes a “honeymoon-like” vacation before they head back home and see if their relationship can work also in the real world.</p><p>Minami Takahashi, here, was allowed to announce her Love Island&nbsp;stint only on the day of its premiere.</p><p>When filming Love Is Blind in Tokyo and Yomitan, Minami found herself coupled with Mori, a 37-year-old cosmetic dermatologist.</p><p>From the solid first impression, Minami and Mori continued to develop their bond while talking about their upbringing and their future family/life to be. And because these elements, along with their expectations, also turned out to be a match, they gradually understood each other on a much deeper level.</p><p>Mori was also initially interested in Ayano. But, he realized that while Ayano never really let her guard down, Minami seemed very sincere even if she said/asked the strangest things sometimes. Mori also knew that Minami was the one for him because they shared the common ground of having a Korean heritage.</p><p>So, the viewers saw Mori confess that he wants to be by Minami’s side while she figured out the balance between being honest and being kind before proposing.</p><p>Then the proposal!</p><p>Mori asked “Even if I were to go blind one day I know that I would still be in love with you. Minami, will you marry me?” To this, Minami gladly said ‘yes’ before adding, “I’ve always had you on my mind, Mori. But I never dreamed that it would turn out this way. I’m overjoyed.”</p><p>Joining Minami and Mori on this dating journey, other than Ayano, were twelve more men: Takumi, Jinya, <a href=#>Yudai</a>, Shuntaro, Odacchi, Atsushi, Sho, <a href=#>Misaki</a>, Ryotaro, Ryoga, Mizuki, Wataru, and 8 more women: Toshie, Midori, Motomi, Maki, Priya, <a href=#>Kaoru</a>, <a href=#>Nana</a>, and Nanako.</p><h3><strong>Are Minami Takahashi And Mori From Love Is Blind Still Together?</strong></h3><p>So despite the age gap, that the viewers were so concerned about, Minami Takahashi and Mori found the ground where they could come together. But did they manage to stay together even outside Love Is Blind?</p><p>Mori does not seem to have an active social media presence. And even Minami’s social media activity gave us no clear clues, to if they are likely still on good terms.</p><p>Still, concerning Minami’s admission that she had such a crazy and wonderful experience and she gave her 120% to this experience, she is likely together with Mori even today.</p><h3><strong>Minami Takahashi Age</strong></h3><p>Minami Takahashi was reportedly born in 1994.
