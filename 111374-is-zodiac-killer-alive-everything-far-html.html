Poste’s facial features match the Zodiac’s sketches, and they have the same shoe size. After decoding his cryptic notes, they discovered his full name. Unfortunately, the new Zodiac suspect passed away in 2018.</p><p class=align-left>The FBI is yet to release an official report but said they would look into the private investigators’ claims. Gary’s <a href=# title="Zodiac killer" rel="nofollow noopener">family has not commented</a> on the matter.
