He’s phenomenal. What he does is, like, crazy,” she told “Entertainment Tonight” earlier this month, when the flick was filming on another location in Boston.</p><p>“When Tom was on top of the car, and I’m inside the car going, ‘Ahhh! Ahhh!’ and he’s on the hood of the car flying through the air, you know, cabled to a car, jumping 20 feet across — I’m like, ‘I want an action scene, you guys! I wanna fight! I wanna be on the hood of a car! Write it! Just write it in somewhere!’ ”</p><p>“Knight & Day,” a thriller about a fugitive couple, is reportedly already costing double its $90 million budget.</p><p>And the running of the bulls, which delayed shooting for days, just helped to jack up the price even further.</p><p>Cruise’s last film, “Valkyrie,” which cost an estimated $75 million to produce, grossed an underwhelming $83 million in the United States.</p><p><a href=#>todd.venezia@nypost.com</a><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfXp7kGpma3FfqbyuecKrrKKrlWKwornEq6anZZSerrt50q6pr6Gmmnq0wMCmp56clWK8r3nMqK2inV2osrV7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
