But the comedian is also romantic, which is something that was further proven over the weekend of July 4, when he was spotted on two public dates with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lake Bell</strong></a>. While we’ll further explain a bit about their alleged relationship and more of his past romances below, we first want to share one of Chris’ many jokes about relationships. During a standup show (Chris Rock: Tamborine) that aired on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Netflix</a>, Chris once said, “love hard or get the f*** out.” He further added that “all you should be doing” in a relationship is “having sex and traveling. F***ing and going places. You should be coming and going.” Now, take a look at his relationship history below!</p><h2><strong>Malaak Compton&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/chris-rock-dating-history-Malaak-Compton-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>Malaak Compton</strong> was Chris Rock’s wife for nearly 20 years. They tied the knot on November 23, 1996 and didn’t finalize their divorce until August 22, 2016, so they were together for a very long time. He eventually opened up about their 2014 split and said he behaved badly while they were married. More specifically, he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>admitted to cheating</a> on her with multiple women. During his Netflix standup show in 2018, he said, “The last few years have been crazy for me. Don’t clap for that s*** unless you’re a lawyer! You don’t wanna get divorced. You got somebody you love? Hold tight, commit. It’s my fault because I’m a f***ing a**hole. I didn’t listen. I wasn’t kind. I had an attitude. I thought, ‘I pay for everything, I can do what I want.’ That s*** don’t f***ing work. I just thought I was the s***. I didn’t play the tambourine.” In the Netflix special, he not only admitted to cheating, he said he had a porn addiction, too — both of which led to the split with his ex-wife. They share two daughters: <strong>Lola </strong>and <strong>Zahra</strong>.</p><h2><strong>Megalyn Echikunwoke&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/chris-rock-dating-history-Megalyn-Echikunwoke-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Chris Rock and <strong>Megalyn Echikunwoke</strong> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>started dating</a> shortly after his divorce from Malaak Compton, according to PEOPLE. It was a more casual relationship than the one he had with Malaak, but it lasted four years before they, too, split.</p><h2><strong>Carmen Ejogo&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/chris-rock-dating-history-Carmen-Ejogo-embed4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>British actress and singer <strong>Carmen Ejogo</strong> was linked to Chris Rock after his split with Megalyn. They allegedly started dating in 2020, and were often spotted on public dates from <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>having lunch together</a> to walking while holding hands. But Chris’ romance with Carmen, who was previously married to trip-hop artist <strong>Tricky</strong> and actor <strong>Jeffrey Wright</strong>, didn’t last very long.</p><h2><strong>Lake Bell&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/chris-rock-dating-history-Megalyn-Echikunwoke-embed1-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Lake Bell is the latest woman to be linked to Chris Rock. Romance speculation first started in the summer of 2022, after they were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted leaving Giorgio Baldi</a> in Santa Monica, CA on July 2, 2022 — less than a month since their last outing at a sports game together. A source told Page Six that the duo showed off a bit of PDA, including holding hands, inside the Italian restaurant, leading many to believe they’re dating each other. They were later seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>having brunch together</a> at Coast Restaurant in Santa Monica, California on Sunday, July 3. And as we said, they were previously seen attending a St. Louis Cardinals baseball game together in mid-June at Busch Stadium. They were hanging out in a box together at the game, which was captured in a video by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Chris has been keeping a low profile professionally ever since he <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was slapped</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Will Smith</strong></a>&nbsp;at the 2022&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Academy Awards</a> earlier this year.
