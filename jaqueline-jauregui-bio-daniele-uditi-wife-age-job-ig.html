But what was meant to be a six-month stint turned into a permanent move, as he fell in love with the beautiful Jaqueline.</span></p><p><span>Fast forward to 2 years of dating, the lovebirds then exchanged vows on June 12, 2012.</span></p><p><span>They were married for over a decade, at the time of writing this article.</span></p><p><span>Prior to meeting Jaqueline, Daniele honed his culinary skills under the guidance of chef Rosanna Marziale at the Michelin-starred </span><i><span>Le Colonne</span></i><span> restaurant in Caserta, Italy.</span></p><p><span>However, the </span><i><span>Best in Dough</span></i><span> judge has been involved in the pastry business ever since he was 12.

They welcomed him in 2017, and watching him grow up has been a blessing for the pair.</span></p><p><span>According to Daniele, raising Kuno around incredible food just as he did was delightful. And the fact that Kuno had a creative eye (he once topped his homemade pizza with Cheetos), was a cherry on the top.</span></p><p><span>“Kuno loves making a mess, like me when I was a kid. Anytime I make pizza, he’s in with his hands in the sticky stuff.
