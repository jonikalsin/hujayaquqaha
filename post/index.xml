ジャンヌ意外でも「Acid Black Cherry」としても成功を収めたカリスマである彼。
実は現在のyasuさんは活動が控え気味になっています。
最新の仕事情報や目撃情報、インスタへの登場などの活動休止後の現在わかっていることをまとめてみたいと思います。
隠れて別のバンドをやっているのではないか？
結婚して嫁をもらって、すでに子供がいるのではないか？
など、ネットにはyasuさん関係で多くの噂があるだけでに気になります。
yasuの病気と活動休止。Janne Da Arcの解散 yasuさんとえば、カリスマ的人気バンド「Janne Da Arc」のボーカルのイメージが強いですね！
そんなJanne Da Arcも2007年に活動休止を発表。
その後、ボーカルのyasuさんはソロプロジェクト「Acid Black Cherry」で活躍。
しかし、yasuさんが”ある病気”を発表すると、yasuさん個人及びAcid Black Cherryの活動も停止。
そして、ずっと眠っていた伝説のバンド「Janne Da Arc」も、2019年に解散が発表されました。
かつて、yasuさんを追ってジャンヌダルクやABCが好きだったファンにとっては散々な近況であります。
yasuは首の病気。「頚椎損傷」はヘドバンが原因？ yasuさんが自身の病気で活動休止することを発表したのは2017年のことでした。
病気のことはホームページ上で発表されました。
「今回のツアーは約一年半振りということもあって本当に楽しみにしてました。それだけに直前にしてこの決断というのは僕も本当に断腸の思いです」
「“期間を決めずに”と聞くと深刻な感じが否めませんが、今回は療養として時間をもらえたので、しばらくそれに甘えさせてもらおうかなと思います。なのであまり心配しなくて大丈夫です」
「ここで1つだけ伝えておきたい事があります。それは首を痛めてしまった原因についてです」
「決して誤解してほしくないのは“ヘドバンをしたからこうなった”ではなくて“ヘドバンをした後のケアを怠ったからこうなった”という事です。今回の件で“やっぱりヘドバンは良くない”という印象がまたさらに強くなるんじゃないか、そんな懸念があります」
当時、ABCのツアー中でありましたが、残りの公演が行えないとして、謝罪文が載せられていました。
所属事務所はyasuの症状について「長年の活動から生じた頚椎の損傷、それに起因する身体各所への痛みなど、複合的な症状の併発」と説明していました。
ファンからは、yasuさんのパフォーマンスの代名詞である”ヘドバン”が原因ではないか？と言われています。
Janne Da Arc解散の理由はka-yuの不祥事脱退・退社 2019年に解散を発表したJanne Da Arc。
長く活動が止まっていただけに、解散は安易に予想できました。
しかし、解散が決まる決定打があまりにも悲惨だったとして話題になりました。
2018年に弁護士事務所からJanne Da Arcの所属事務所当てに手紙が届き、彼が反社会的な行為をしていたことが明らかになりました。
解散のニュースで詳細が語られなかったのは、これから起こる裁判の都合があったからだそうです。
ネット上では「詐欺や恐喝」という噂が広がっています。
古くからファンの方に「ka-yuにお金を要求された」という方もいたそうです。
この不祥事ニュースの直後、すぐに解散が発表され、心の中でバンドの再集結を夢いたファンは愕然としました。
yasuの現在。Twitterなどの目撃情報 2017年に活動休止を発表したyasuさん。
その後も現在までに歌手活動は再開されていません。
現在までのyasuさんの動きの把握はmバンド仲間のTwitterやインスタグラム、またはネット上の噂が頼りとなっています。
休止発表の翌年の2018年1月に久々にSNSでファンの前に顔を出しました。
バンド「ナイトメア」のギタリスト・柩のInstagramにおいて、最新のyasuの姿が公開され話題となりました。
中段の右から２番目にいるのがyasuさんです。
柩さんはInstagramで、
「少しだけ早めのハッピーバースデー会！hydeさんいつも優しい神素敵＆yasu兄さん元気そうで良かった素敵。お祝い出来て嬉しかったー！！」
とのコメントを載せていました。
また、バースデーパーティー投稿の後、春頃にアパレルブランド「QALB」の公式Instagramに同ブランドの服を着たyasuの姿が公開されました。
この投稿を最後に、yasuさん姿をSNS上でさえ見れなくなりました。</description></item><item><title>Kai Jones Net Worth, Salary, Career Earnings The Talks Today</title><link>/kai-jones-net-worth-salary-career-earnings.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/kai-jones-net-worth-salary-career-earnings.html</guid><description>Kai Jones’ information about his net worth, salary, and career earnings have been shared in this article to enable fans to know more about him.
