The <a href=#>rapper</a>, who was born in Trinidad, has a long list of accomplishments to her credit, including holding the record for the longest-charting female rapper of all time (Missy Elliot previously held the distinction). Since Lil Wayne took her under his wing and helped her start her career, she has been a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>But Minaj’s fortitude goes beyond the difficulties she has faced in the rap business. The “Barbie Dreams” artist was raised in a troubled household that was filled with alcoholism and abuse, and the difficulties she had as a child motivated her to succeed. According to the woman who spoke to Rolling Stone, “When I first came to America, I would go in my room and bow down at the foot of my bed and pray that god would make me rich so that I could take care of my mother.”</p><p>Minaj has settled down with her longtime partner Kenneth Petty after realizing her ambitions. In public, they call their kid, whom they welcomed in 2020, “Papa Bear.” Many previous suitors have knocked on the doors of the “Super Bass” singer’s Barbie kingdom. We’re going into Nicki Minaj’s whole dating history (and what her ex-boyfriends have said) before her marriage to convicted sex offender Kenneth Petty.</p><h3>Nicki Minaj’s tumultuous relationship with Safaree Samuels</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nicki-minajs-tumultuous-relationship-with-safaree-samuels-1680716533.jpg alt="nicki minaj husband,nicki minaj ex husband,nicki minaj and safaree relationship,nicki minaj and michael b jordan,what happened with safaree and nicki minaj,how long was safaree and nicki minaj together,nicki minaj and nas,safaree nicki minaj tattoo,nicki minaj dating history list,who has nicki minaj dated before,nicki minaj relationship history,nicki minaj making history,nicki minaj history,nicki minaj dating timeline" width=390 height=219 sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>For more than ten years, Nicki Minaj dated Safaree Samuels. Early in the 2000s, they both joined the Hood$tars rap group, but their friendship was marred by rumors of police involvement and public disputes.</p><p>In 2011, after TMZ got a police record following an incident between Minaj and a man officers allegedly identified as Samuels, rumors about difficulties in the couple’s relationship initially started to circulate. Samuels allegedly hit the rapper across the jaw and lower lip during an argument with a bag. Minaj decided against filing a complaint. Despite the fact that they were still seeing each other, their issues were far from resolved.</p><p>The couple broke up in 2014 amid rumors of jealously over Minaj’s success, which Samuels said he helped shape. The song “Bed of Lies,” which Minaj released, was widely believed to be about her unhealthy relationship with Samuels. The rapper claimed Minaj owed him money for years of assistance with her music when he filed a lawsuit against her for music credit. Samuels eventually withdrew the lawsuit, but years after their breakup, the two were still at odds in their <a href=#>songs</a> and on Twitter. Rapper Meek Mill alleged that Minaj had been disloyal to him, while Samuels claimed that Minaj had been using him. He said, she said is the situation here. Samuels said in a tweet that the rapper stabbed him in 2014 while brandishing a knife. TMZ claims to have seen a video of the incident, though this has never been corroborated.</p><p>Call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at (800) 799-7233 if you or someone you know is a victim of domestic violence.

After they denied dating rumors for almost a year, Mill made their relationship Facebook “official” in 2015 by writing, “Choose a woman that you think is powerful enough 2 assist you control the globe wit you!” next to a picture of Minaj.</p><p>Their romance soured in 2016 after Minaj posted the following telling Instagram caption: “I thank God that I escaped harm. I’m done with you. Sweetheart, you’re looking good.” Minaj tweeted in 2017 to declare their breakup, but the feud persisted. A TMZ video of a fight between Mill, Minaj, and her husband Kenneth Petty that occurred when they all ended up at the same West Hollywood store surfaced in January 2020. A month later, Minaj appeared to accuse her ex on Twitter of abusing her physically, and Mill responded that Minaj had assisted her brother in avoiding a rape conviction.</p><p>Help is available if you or someone you know has experienced a sexual assault.

When Nas appeared in Minaj’s music video for her song “Right By My Side” in 2012, the two became close and exchanged a sensual kiss. When the Barbie queen posted an Instagram snapshot of the artists enjoying a romantic night at Nas’ restaurant in 2017, it ignited new relationship suspicions. “Only KINGS acknowledge QUEENS. The meal at [Sweet Chick] is the finest. thank you @nas, “The caption was written by a rapper.</p><p>The “On “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” the rapper was praised by the artist of “Bang Bang,” who said, “He’s really great. Both of us are from Queens. And while I like to think of myself as the queen of Queens, he is the king of Queens.” Minaj told DeGeneres in 2017 that she didn’t want anything meaningful after her breakup with Mill. “Right now, I’m simply chilling. I’m chaste. I intended to avoid dating any men for a full year. She admitted, “I despise males, but I could make an exception for [Nas] since he’s so dope.”</p><p>After seeing each other for seven months, their romance ended because, according to rumors, having different zip codes made things difficult for the rap pair. Without engaging in the customary Barbz Twitter spat, the two parted ways in amicable fashion.</p><h3>Did Nicki Minaj date Drake?</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/did-nicki-minaj-date-drake-1680702767.jpg alt="nicki minaj husband,nicki minaj ex husband,nicki minaj and safaree relationship,nicki minaj and michael b jordan,what happened with safaree and nicki minaj,how long was safaree and nicki minaj together,nicki minaj and nas,safaree nicki minaj tattoo,nicki minaj dating history list,who has nicki minaj dated before,nicki minaj relationship history,nicki minaj making history,nicki minaj history,nicki minaj dating timeline" width=390 height=219 sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Together, <a href=#>Drake</a> and Nicki Minaj have a long history with their individual rap industry breakthroughs. Fans naturally began to wonder if the rap duo’s connection was more than just a friendship, and Drake’s <a href=#>song lyrics</a> did nothing to put an end to the suspicions. The rapper declares his love for Nicki Minaj in the song “Miss Me” from 2010: “I told her I’d acknowledge it/ I hope one day we get married just to say we f***ing did it.” Years of rumors were stoked by the couple’s unmistakable chemistry on stage. In 2010, Drake even addressed Minaj as “Mrs. Aubrey Drake Graham” on Twitter, but fans dismissed this as playful flirting.</p><p>In 2015, the singer of “Anaconda” found herself in the center of a dispute between Champagne Papi and her ex-boyfriend Meek Mill after Meek implied Drake wasn’t composing his own songs. With Zane Lowe of Apple Music 1, the rapper talked openly about the conflict. “It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my career. I felt so trapped in that moment since I did at the time love both of them.”</p><p>Putting their feud to rest in 2018, Drake and Mill collaborated on the song “Going Bad” after engaging in one of the most notorious diss tracks in rap history. Drake and Minaj continue to be good friends because both of them were able to get over their pasts. Along with their former mentor Lil Wayne, the two got back together in 2022 for a special Young Money reunion event in Toronto.</p><h3>Nicki Minaj’s alleged romance with Quavo</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nicki-minajs-alleged-romance-with-quavo-1680794826.jpg alt="nicki minaj husband,nicki minaj ex husband,nicki minaj and safaree relationship,nicki minaj and michael b jordan,what happened with safaree and nicki minaj,how long was safaree and nicki minaj together,nicki minaj and nas,safaree nicki minaj tattoo,nicki minaj dating history list,who has nicki minaj dated before,nicki minaj relationship history,nicki minaj making history,nicki minaj history,nicki minaj dating timeline" width=390 height=219 sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Quavo, an <a href=#>Atlanta</a> rapper, and Nicki Minaj have a rocky relationship. Along with Cardi B, they both participated on his 2017 Migos song “MotorSport.” Despite some scheduling issues that prevented Cardi and Nicki from filming their music video sequences on the same day, the “Bed Of Lies” musician admitted in an interview with Zane Lowe that she was open to the notion of working alongside the “Bodak Yellow” star at Quavo’s request. Cardi B gave an interview soon after the song’s release that offended Minaj, most likely with Capital Xtra. Minaj also expressed disappointment with Quavo for not standing up for her when she was attacked by fans for her feud with Cardi. According to reports, Quavo texted her in reply, saying, “If you were my lady, I would go on Twitter and back you up.”</p><p>After the song’s release, the two appeared to put their disagreements behind them, but only temporarily. In her 2018 diss song “Barbie Dreams,” she made fun of the rapper “Stir Fry.” Someone check on Karrueche, though, I heard she thinks I’m trying to give Quavo the coochie, sings Minaj in reference to Quavo’s ex. She tweeted after the song was released, “In #BarbieDreams, I only addressed those that I f*** with. This is not meant as a criticism.”</p><p>To counter Minaj’s jab, Quavo released his own song, “Huncho Dreams.” She said I damaged her feelings 52 times/ Call up queen (Nicki)/ The queen can’t flex on a young bull/ Made her scream, the rapper said, alluding to sleeping with her.</p><h3>She opened up about having an abortion</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/she-opened-up-about-having-an-abortion-1680790517.jpg alt="nicki minaj husband,nicki minaj ex husband,nicki minaj and safaree relationship,nicki minaj and michael b jordan,what happened with safaree and nicki minaj,how long was safaree and nicki minaj together,nicki minaj and nas,safaree nicki minaj tattoo,nicki minaj dating history list,who has nicki minaj dated before,nicki minaj relationship history,nicki minaj making history,nicki minaj history,nicki minaj dating timeline" width=390 height=219 sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The unanticipated pregnancy Nicki Minaj had with her ex Aaron when she was barely a teenager made her vulnerable. The rapper made a reference to her past in the song “All Things Go,” saying, “My child with Aaron, would’ve been 16 any minute.” She spoke openly about choosing to end her pregnancy in a 2014 Rolling Stone interview. “I was a young adult. It was the most difficult experience I had ever had, she added, adding that it would be paradoxical if she claimed she wasn’t pro-choice. I was unprepared. I had nothing to offer a youngster.”</p><p>Minaj acknowledged that she had been troubled by her decision to forgo having children her entire life. Although the song “All Things Go” may have gained attention, this isn’t the first time the celebrity has spoken up about her abortion. Throughout her path “”Baby, baby, pardon me, mommy was young/ Mommy was too busy, trying to have fun/ Now I don’t thank myself on the back, for sending you back/ ‘Cause God knows, I was better than that,” she raps in “Autobiography.” I listened to those who claimed that I wasn’t prepared for you, but how the f*** would they know what I was capable of?”</p><p>The rapper also talked openly about cheating on her high school sweetheart. She admitted to cheating on him (perhaps Aaron, who was supposedly older than her) while attending night school, according to All Urban Central.</p><h3>Nicki Minaj’s rumored romances</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nicki-minajs-rumored-romances-1680702767.jpg alt="nicki minaj husband,nicki minaj ex husband,nicki minaj and safaree relationship,nicki minaj and michael b jordan,what happened with safaree and nicki minaj,how long was safaree and nicki minaj together,nicki minaj and nas,safaree nicki minaj tattoo,nicki minaj dating history list,who has nicki minaj dated before,nicki minaj relationship history,nicki minaj making history,nicki minaj history,nicki minaj dating timeline" width=390 height=219 sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Over her career, Nicki Minaj has been the target of several relationship rumors, however the Barbie queen neither confirms nor rejects them. Fans believed she was dating British professional racing car driver Lewis Hamilton in 2018. The “Caribbean tingz what I on, the artist captioned an Instagram photo of herself and Hamilton riding across Dubai’s dunes. Lewis and I are getting paper to let the ink dry on.” The two were seen leaving a hotel together, but their relationship ultimately ended.</p><p>The Atlanta rapper Future may have sent the “Ganja Burn” musician some <a href=#>expensive gifts</a> that same year, which led to additional links between them. “Thank you, you know the way to a Barbie’s [heart],” Minaj captioned a video she posted on Instagram of herself unpacking Chanel gift boxes. Many believed Future was the source of the Chanel purse despite the possibility that it was simply a corporate gift after seeing similar packaging on his Instagram.</p><p>In her 2010 song “Roman’s Revenge,” which she featured rapper Eminem on, Minaj also made light of a hypothetical romance. The two have remained amorous, with Eminem even asking the audience at one of his concerts in 2018 whether or not he should date her. Although there was never any real tension between the rappers, they offered fans plenty of fodder for rumors. “Em, you must appear on the Queen album. Our first date will take place there, in the studio, as I watch you write a poem and gaze into your stunning eyes “Inside the same day, Minaj tweeted.</p><h3>Nicki Minaj married a registered sex offender</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nicki-minaj-married-a-registered-sex-offender-1680702767.jpg alt="nicki minaj husband,nicki minaj ex husband,nicki minaj and safaree relationship,nicki minaj and michael b jordan,what happened with safaree and nicki minaj,how long was safaree and nicki minaj together,nicki minaj and nas,safaree nicki minaj tattoo,nicki minaj dating history list,who has nicki minaj dated before,nicki minaj relationship history,nicki minaj making history,nicki minaj history,nicki minaj dating timeline" width=390 height=219 sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The relationship between Nicki Minaj and Kenneth Petty drew criticism from tabloids. Following a year of becoming public with their love, the couple were married in 2019. In response to Petty’s criminal past resurfacing and posing a threat to his public persona, Minaj has publicly defended him. According to USA Today, Petty was sentenced to years in prison after being found guilty of first-degree attempted rape in 1995 and first-degree manslaughter in 2006. The “The rapper of “Starships” made a reference to the rape case on Instagram, writing in response to comments about a picture of herself and Petty, “…he was 15, she was 16, in a relationship. But, Internet, go awf. You cannot control my life. You two can’t even manage their own lives, “Minaj penned.</p><p>Nonetheless, the relationship between the two dates back to their teenage years. According to a source who spoke to Us Weekly, the couple got back in touch after the rapper visited her native Queens to volunteer. Minaj has always desired to settle down, and she even revealed to Complex that she has a certain plan for her future. She declared in 2014: “I feel like I was put here to be a mother, therefore no matter how much money I had, if I finish my fifth album and I don’t have a child by then, I would be unhappy as a woman. Minaj will deliver her son in the fall of 2020, long before the release of her fifth album, so she is on schedule. According to CBS Los Angeles, Petty was given a one-year home detention term and three-year probationary period in 2022 because he neglected to register as a sex offender.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="nicki minaj husband,nicki minaj ex husband,nicki minaj and safaree relationship,nicki minaj and michael b jordan,what happened with safaree and nicki minaj,how long was safaree and nicki minaj together,nicki minaj and nas,safaree nicki minaj tattoo,nicki minaj dating history list,who has nicki minaj dated before,nicki minaj relationship history,nicki minaj making history,nicki minaj history,nicki minaj dating timeline" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
