Sunday, November 20th, Blake commented via Instagram video:</p><p><strong>“I’m going to surprise G this morning by formally inviting her to move in with me.”</strong></p><p>All-Star Beach Blake penned “Will You Move In With Me?” in the snow and anticipated that Giannina would respond by constructing a snow statue in the yard. Giannina ultimately consented, and a kiss sealed the deal.</p><p>Blake Horstmann and Giannina Gibelli met on the show All-Star Shore.</p><p>Giannina Gibelli and Blake Horstmann first met while filming All-Star Shore for the Paramount+ network. Prior to this year’s premiere of All-Star Shore, the couple was required to conceal their relationship. Blake described in Us Weekly:</p><p><strong>“We had to keep our relationship a secret for the first six months, which was in a way pleasurable because we were able to be ourselves without public scrutiny. However, it was also challenging, as it is never pleasant to conceal a loved one.”</strong></p><p>He also stated that despite being in the spotlight for four years, this was the “first time” he had “dated anyone in public.”</p><p>Blake rose to prominence during season 14 of The Bachelorette with Becca Kufrin. The 32-year-old went on to feature in consecutive seasons of Bachelor in Paradise despite being eliminated in the finale.</p><p>Blake was criticized during season 6 of Bachelor in Paradise for his pre-show encounters with Kristina Schulman and Caelynn Miller-Keyes after finishing as runner-up in the 2018 season.</p><p>During the 2019 season, Blake posted Caelynn’s text messages on Instagram. In 2021, he discussed the drama on the podcast Here for the Right Reasons by Us Weekly.</p><p><strong>“I have no remorse. I will never offer an apology for this. Never will I regret or repent for defending myself.”</strong></p><p>For her part, Giannina became engaged to Damian Powers during the first season of Love Is Blind. Despite Damian’s cancellation of their nuptials in the series finale, they continued dating intermittently until 2021.</p><p>Damian and Francesca Farago divorced in August 2021 after Damian was suspected of infidelity with Too Hot to Handle Francesca Farago. Damian, on the contrary, denied the accusations. Giannina told Entertainment Tonight about her breakup at the time:</p><p><strong>“I haven’t dated Damian for a few months now. I’ve evolved. I am in excellent health.My existence is unquestionably at a high point.”</strong></p><p>Gibelli and Blake began courting while filming All-Star Shore, but they were required to conceal their relationship until the premiere of the series.</p><p>Gibelli eventually made her relationship with Blake public in June, after the news of All-Star Shore broke. She informed E! News:</p><p><strong>“I had never seen the Bachelor series or anything similar, so I had no notion who he was. He seemed familiar to me, and he simply smiled at me; this is how I met him on the beach.”</strong></p><p>Blake revealed his connection with Gibelli during a July 13 How Men Think podcast session.</p><p><strong>“Fortuitously, I met Giannina quickly, and we struck it off immediately; I’m so glad we did… I am currently ecstatic.”</strong></p><p>The All-Star Shore couple, on the other hand, initially took things cautiously due to previous relationships, but they are still going strong and plan to continue doing so in the future.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Scott Thompson Top On Body Enhancements And Plastic Surgery Disasters"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":37248,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/scott-thompson-top-on-body-enhancements-and-plastic-surgery-disasters/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/scott-thompson-top-on-body-enhancements-and-plastic-surgery-disasters/"}{"1":80}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Scott Thompson Top On Body Enhancements And Plastic Surgery Disasters</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Television Personality</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Maya Jama Will Take Over As Presenter Of Love Island For Laura Whitmore</a></h3>The dating program Love Island on ITV2 will now be hosted by Maya Jama, it has been confirmed.
