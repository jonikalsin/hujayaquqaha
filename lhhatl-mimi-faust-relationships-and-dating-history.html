From a broken engagement (only to be engaged to the same person again) to a self-leaked s*x tape, Mimi’s dating life has caught the viewers’ attention time and time again.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Today, let’s take a deeper look at Mimi’s past relationships and her dating history.</span></p><h3><b>LHHATL Mimi Faust Relationships And Dating History</b></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Ty Long</strong></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mimi Faust’s last known girlfriend/fiancee is Ty Young.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The two have had a tumultuous relationship over the past few years. Starting their love story in 2016, the couple went on to get engaged in 2020. However, less than a year after Ty proposed, the couple called off their engagement.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to Mimi, they ultimately wanted “different” things out of life. And when Ty suddenly proposed she felt pressured. “I had expressed this to Ty, but Ty is a born athlete, she’s a natural-born winner, she’s just used to getting what she wants. And so that is what she wanted and she pressed forward with what she wanted, regardless of anybody else saying how they felt about it,” she explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But surprisingly, they reconciled and gave fans the good news via IG live. So, fast-forward to January 2022,&nbsp; the couple got engaged again and it was Ty again who popped the question. Unfortunately, what’s never meant to happen will never happen. In March 2022, a viral video circulated showing Ty Young cozying up to another woman. Not soon after Ty announced that she was a single woman.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Just a few days before Ty announced she was single, Mimi had made a WCW post on Instagram tagging Ty.</span></p><ul><li><h4><strong>Stevie J</strong></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Prior to Ty, the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>LHHATL</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> star dated Stevie J. for a long time — until Stevie decided to mess around with Joseline Hernandez behind Mimi’s back. After Mimi discovered she was in a love triangle, she backed off and moved on from the romance.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Guilty of his actions, Stevie J. apologized to Mimi multiple times. He even showed up on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Love & Hip Hop Family Reunion</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and apologized to her in front of everyone.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The apology took place poolside. Stevie admitted he was young and foolish back then and he now realized how their thing could ultimately affect their child.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But even though Mimi appeared very receptive at the moment, she later blamed him for her first engagement to fail.</span></p><ul><li><h4><strong>Nikko London</strong></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, just prior to dating Ty, Mimi intentionally “leaked” a s*x tape with her ex-boyfriend Nikko London. Though initially, she mentioned that the was stolen from Nikko’s bag at the airport, Nikko later confessed that their lovemaking was like art and that it needed to be documented for the public eye.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to an insider, Mimi was trying to make a name for herself and become relevant. “She’s riding this new wave of fame until it ends. She did it for the money and from what I’m hearing she cashed in about 100 racks,” the source added.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Likewise, Nikko blamed the star claiming that Mimi was still “torn” about her ex-boyfriend Stevie J and felt like she was “losing to the other woman.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Besides Ty Young, Stevie J, and Nikko, Mimi was also romantically linked to T.I., Scarface, and Ja Rule.</span></p><h3><b>Mimi Faust Daughter</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mimi Faust shares a daughter named Eva Giselle Jordan with Stevie J.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her daughter, Eva Giselle was born on December 13, 2009, in Atlanta, Georgia. And now, she’s already a reality star who starred in the first four seasons of L</span><i><span style=font-weight:400>ove & Hip Hop: Atlanta</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, as well as on one episode of the spin-off show </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Stevie J & Joseline: Go Hollywood</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Eva appeared as a supporting cast member on two seasons of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Leave It to Stevie.</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Natally, she has garnered over 252K followers on her IG @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>iamevagiselle</span></a>,<span style=font-weight:400> and the last we checked she left social media in shambles with her Steve Harvey impersonation.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In a roughly 30-second clip posted to her IG, Eva appeared alongside a friend as she sported a thick fake mustache similar to Harvey’s signature look. What’s more, Eva’s mannerisms and hand gestures made the clip even funnier.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Mimi Faust?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mimi Faust was born on January 3, 1972. That made her 50 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She is 14 years younger than Ty Young and a year younger than Stevie J.</span></p><h3><b>Mimi Faust Net Worth</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mimi Faust flaunted a net worth of $2 million in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>At odds with her mother ever since the age of 13, Mimi quickly learned to be self-reliant and enterprising. This led her on a quest to find her father and when she finally did, she learned that she had inherited his artistic tastes and creative influences.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thus, she began cleaning and decorating for celebrity homes, and eventually, it turned into a thriving business known as </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Keep It Clean</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Mimi Faust Height</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mimi Faust stands tall at a height of 5 feet 8 inches (173 cm).</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>What Is Mimi Faust Zodiac Sign?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mimi is a Capricorn.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>What Is Mimi Faust Real Name?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mimi’s real name is Oluremi Fela James.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Who Are Mimi Faust Parents?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mimi was born to her parents, Olaiya Odufunke, and an anonymous father.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sadly, her mother Olaiya (who chose Scientology over her own children) passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2003.
