Despite the fact that she was a talented actress, late in life Erin had some problems with money and&nbsp; announced that she was in debt. She passed away in April 2017.</p><p>So you might wonder how rich was Erin Moran? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that Moran’s net worth was $100,000 dollars –&nbsp; her last role was in the movie of 2012, entitled ‘The Deceit’.</p><h3>Erin Moran Net Worth $100,000</h3><p>When Erin was just a young girl her mother signed her to an acting agency, and in the mid-’60s she became a part of the children’s drama series, ‘Daktari’, created by Art Arthur and Ivan Tors, having an opportunity to work with <a href=#>Cheryl Miller</a>, Marshall Thompson, Hari Rhodes and others. In 1968 Erin appeared in the movie entitled ‘How Sweet It Is!’, directed by Jerry Paris,during the filming of which she worked with <a href=#>James Garner</a>, <a href=#>Penny Marshall</a>, <a href=#>Debbie Reynolds</a> and others.&nbsp; Later she also appeared in such movies and shows as ‘Watermelon Man’, ‘Family Affair’, ‘My Three Sons’, ‘The Don Rickles Show’ among others. These appearances laid a firm basis for Erin’s net worth.</p><p>In 1974 Erin was cast in the role for which she is best known, that of Joanie Cunningham in the TV ‘Happy Days’. This show was very successful and Erin became more popular, working with <a href=#>Ron Howard</a>, <a href=#>Henry Winkler</a>, <a href=#>Tom Bosley</a> and many others, so adding significantly on the growth of Erin’s&nbsp; net worth. In 1982 Erin also acted in ‘Jonie Loves Chachi’, but the show was cancelled after a year, and she again appeared in ‘Happy Days’. In 2007 Moran appeared in the film ‘Not Another B Movie’, directed by John Wesley Norton, working with Byron Thames, Larry Thomas, Joe Estevez and others.&nbsp; Other TV shows in which Moran appeared include ‘Murder, She Wrote’, ‘Diagnosis: Murder’ and ‘The Love Boat’, all adding somewhat to Erin’s net worth.</p><p>In 2011, Erin together with <a href=#>Anson Williams</a>, <a href=#>Don Most</a> and <a href=#>Marion Ross</a> filed a lawsuit against CBS, as the actors were dissatisfied with not being paid for revenues, such as T-shirts, trading cards, dolls and other items – the lawsuit ended with the actors receiving $65,000.</p><p>In her personal life, Moran married Rocky Ferguson in 1987 – they divorced in 1993; lLater that year, she married Steven Fleischmann. Subsequently Erin apparently suffered periods of depression, and found acting roles hard to come by; consequently her financial situation deteriorated, and she allegedly took to alcohol. Her California home was foreclosed on, and she moved to Indiana with her husband. Erin Moran died from the effects of throat cancer on 22 April 2017, in Corydon, Indiana, at the age of 56.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjsLC5jp6poqZdoryzrc1mpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
