I believe she has a lovely soul.</p><p>Tom revealed to Scheana Shay in this week’s episode of Vanderpump Rules on Bravo that he had spent the previous night “hanging out” with Wenberg, who has routinely collaborated with the characters of the programme since 2015.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/NYPICHPDPICT000006334096.jpg alt="tom schwartz and jo wenberg relationship" width=1280 height=1828 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Schwartz denied ever having a hookup with Jo at the time. “We’re not living together and we’re not dating either,” he stated when asked about his connection with Wenberg at the time. “But she’s just someone I deeply love and she’s a really wonderful human being, so we’re just hanging around,” he said.</p><p>Bravo cameras caught Tom and Shay talking about Wenberg in July 2022.

He had a brief affair with Raquel Leviss while season 10 was being made.</p><p>Tom said, “I recently ended a 12-year relationship. I am unable to be committed and I am unable to enter another relationship. I’m kind of consumed with, like, business and my family, and I’m kind of falling in love with myself all over again, so it wouldn’t be fair to the other person.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/NYPICHPDPICT000006988225-1.jpg alt="tom schwartz and jo wenberg relationship" width=600 height=750 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>When did Tom Schwartz and Katie Maloney split?</h3><p>For those of you who are unaware, let us inform you that Tom and Katie, who had been married for five years, announced their separation in the spring of 2022. The following October, their divorce was finally completed.</p><p>Katie said on a recent episode of “Pump Rules” that Schwartz’s commitment to his new bar contributed to their breakup.
