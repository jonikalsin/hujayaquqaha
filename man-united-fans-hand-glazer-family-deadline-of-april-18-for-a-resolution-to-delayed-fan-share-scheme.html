scheme</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-06-02</div><p class=mol-para-with-font>Manchester United fans have called on their Glazer owners to finally deliver a fan share scheme to enable supporters to own shares with the same voting rights as them by 18 April.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Next month marks 12 months since the world of football was left reeling after the confirmation that 12 of the biggest clubs, spearheaded by the Premier League’s ‘Big Six’, had signed up for a new European Super League.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After the collapse of the breakaway competition just days later, United declared their commitment to building a better relationship with supporters and launched a fan advisory board in December.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The club also confirmed in November last year they were ‘in advanced talks’ with the Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST) about setting up a fans’ share scheme that would give supporters a ‘meaningful ownership stake’ in the club.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But after rejecting an initial proposal from the club despite&nbsp;‘prolonged discussions with the club’, MUST said United had ‘not yet made a proposal to us that is sufficiently acceptable to us to allow it to go to the next stage, which would be a members’ ballot’.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The group then warned it is ‘inconceivable’ there is not definitive action before the anniversary of the bombshell announcement regarding the Super League, especially as Ralf Rangnick’s men ‘continue to decline’ on the field.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Negotiations on these matters can take some time, but we can’t allow them to drag on forever, particularly as in the meantime we continue to see our club decline on the field,’ it added.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async id=i-f9122b69625f6e0b

April last year over United’s role in the failed ESL and appeared at two fans’ forums to try and foster a better relationship with supporters, as well as agreeing to set up the new fans’ advisory

would be set up and ready to go at the start of this season.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But the MUST communication showed half of the United fans surveyed fear the club may try to push through another a version of the ESL proposal.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The United fans surveyed were thoroughly against such a move by a four-to-one majority.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The share scheme is seen as the most significant gesture by the Glazers to improve relations with supporters, not least because it would involve a new class of fan shares each with the same high-vote
