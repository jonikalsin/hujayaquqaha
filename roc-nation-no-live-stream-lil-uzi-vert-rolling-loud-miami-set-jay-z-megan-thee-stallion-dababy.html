From Trippie Red’s chain getting snatched to Coi Leray performing to a still crowd and <a href=#>DaBaby</a> mocking Megan Thee Stallion by calling Tory Lanez on stage, fans got too much gossip to digest.</p><p>Now, before the coveted festival wrapped up on Sunday, July 25, <a href=#>Lil Uzi Vert’s</a> performance was another gossip that made it to the Internet, all thanks to Roc Nation not allowing the <a href=#>rapper’s</a> set to stream online for people sitting at home. Social media users then thronged to Twitter to slam <a href=#>Jay-Z</a> owned Roc Nation for ruining their experience. Interestingly, Rolling Loud’s co-founder Tariq Cherif also jumped into the fire when he asked social media users whether he should go against the giant label or simply abide by their rules.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong><br><a href=#>Why did Mariah Carey quit Jay-Z's Roc Nation?

He came under the label’s umbrella following his tussle with his earlier record label Generation Now. Lil Uzi, who performed a slew of his hits from his extensive discography, also debuted a new song. However, since the music lovers sitting at home could not enjoy the performance, they took to Twitter to brutally drag Jay-Z’s founded company. A few people also noticed how Megan Thee Stallion, who is also signed to the same record label, did not face any such issue as fans thoroughly enjoyed her live streamed performance. &nbsp;Though Roc Nation has not shared any official comment on the same, it is believed that they did not allow the live streaming due to copyright issues and other legal hassles.</p><p>Rolling Loud’s co-founder Cherif also grabbed a lot of attention when he tweeted, “Roc nation won’t let us stream Uzi but I’m thinking about just streaming him anyway. I love jay z but Desiree be on that bull shit. What y’all think? Should I say f**k it and stream him? Or play it safe and listen to the roc?” Reverting to this one said, “Thousands of us were waiting… gofund the fine, we’ll pay it.” Another replied, “Have you exhausted every option to try get them to approve it? You don’t wanna burn any bridges bro.” Whereas, one asked, “How much can they sue you for? Is it worth it? I’m guessing not lol.”</p><p>After getting canceled in 2020 due to the deadly coronavirus, the Rolling Loud Miami 2021 opened its gates to ardent music lovers on Friday, July 23. Artists namely A$AP Rocky, Travis Scott, and Post Malone were the headliners of the mega-event.&nbsp; Speaking of other editions of the festival, the Rolling Loud New York edition will take place from October 28 to 30 whereas, the California edition of the same will be held from December 10-12.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/9965f031-a8e1-4e0e-adc9-f6d8706153f3.1083448904><p dir=ltr lang=en>Roc nation won’t let us stream Uzi but I’m thinking about just streaming him anyway.
