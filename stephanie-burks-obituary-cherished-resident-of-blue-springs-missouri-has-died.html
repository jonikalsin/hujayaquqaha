Stephanie’s date of birth is 2/1/88 and she was born in Fullerton, CA. Her most prized responsibilities were those of mother, wife, sister, and daughter.</p><p>When she was among her family, she felt the most joy. She had boundless affection for her loved ones and took great pleasure in spending time with them. Stephanie loved music of all genres, and her love of trying new restaurants and foods made her a true “foodie.”</p><p>Stephanie and her devoted husband Mike set a wonderful example of love and commitment in their marriage. Her zest for life was contagious, and it was one she showed through traveling the world (or at least the beautiful state of Missouri). Stephanie was devoted to her job with the city of Blue Springs.</p><p>Stephanie’s parents, Norman and Caroline Flansburg, as well as her grandparents, Robert and Frances Davis, and her brother, Bobby Davis, all passed away before she was born. Those who survive her will always remember her with love and affection.</p><p>Michael Burks, Stephanie’s devoted husband, and their two beautiful children, Annabelle and Jaxson, are her sole heirs. She is also survived by her loving sisters Amanda, Amber, Lindsay, and Katie; her mother, Nancy; her father, Greg; her mother-in-law, Debbie; her father-in-law, Joe; and many loving aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends.</p><p>Those who had the privilege of knowing Stephanie will forever cherish her memory. All who were lucky enough to have known her will forever treasure her legacy of love, humor, and enthusiasm for life. While Stephanie’s physical presence may be gone, her legacy lives on in the hearts of all who knew and loved her. Her passing will leave a void in the lives of those who knew her, but her legacy will live on in their hearts and minds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZMC1sc%2BhmKehlWKvtr7KrGSompmpwqK%2B2GaaoZ2insCpscNmqZ6rmZmyr8CMqJ1mmpyqsm6%2Fz6ugp5%2BjYrqqv9KorKuhXZ2utHnDopydZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
