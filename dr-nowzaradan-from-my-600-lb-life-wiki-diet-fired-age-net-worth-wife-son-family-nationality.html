People often call him by his nickname Dr. Now, but his real name is <a rel=nofollow href=#>Younan Nowzaradan</a>. As the name clearly indicates, he is not a native American, but comes from Iran, born on 11 October 1944, and moved to the USA soon after receiving his medical degree from the University of Tehran in 1970. Since Dr. Now is a highly interesting and captivating person, here is some more information about his personal life and career.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s crazy how advanced technology is today! <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/3tMPOF7PPk</a></p><p>— Dr Nowzaradan (@DrNowzaradan) <a rel=nofollow href=#>January 20, 2018</a></p><h2><span id=Medical_career_the_beginnings>Medical career – the beginnings</span></h2><p>Dr. Nowzaradan didn’t want to start practicing medicine in his home country, and he immediately started looking for a way to move to the USA and continue his education. First, he moved to Tennessee, but soon afterwards to Houston, Texas, where he still resides, operating in several high-profile hospitals around the state.</p><h2><span id=My_600-lb_Life>“My 600-lb Life”</span></h2><p>The show that made Younan Nowzaradan so famous across the country is called “<a rel=nofollow href=#>My 600-lb Life”</a>, a reality TV series produced by TLC. The show first appeared on screens back in 2012, and lasted for five seasons up until 2017. During those five seasons, dozens of highly obese, plus those simply overweight people, tried to lose weight under the guidance of Dr. Now. By often weighing more than 600 pounds (270kg), these individuals were experiencing a huge risk of losing their life. Luckily, the Iranian-born doctor helped them shed excess fat, and every one of these success stories had an impact on the overall popularity of the show.</p><p>“My 600-lb Life” is set in a clinic at 4009 Bellaire Boulevard, Houston, and Dr. Now personally overviews the patients and prescribes diet plans. He also performs surgery on some patients, these operations including gastric bypass, gastric sleeve, and laparoscopic surgery.</p><h2><span id=What_is_his_net_worth>What is his net worth?</span></h2><p>Since Dr. Now has more than 48 years of experience in the medical field, it is no surprise that he is a pretty wealthy man. According to authoritative sources, his overall net worth is around $3 million, but this is not an official confirmed, and therefore you should take it with a pinch of salt. Aside from being the star of a highly popular TV reality show, Dr. Now has medical membership of several organizations across the country. For instance, he is a member of the following clinics located in the Houston area alone: University General Hospital, First Street Hospital, Surgery Specialty Hospital, Renaissance Hospital, and Doctors Hospital at Tidwell.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Other than that, Dr. Nowzaradan has appeared on “Oprah”, and he is the author of the book entitled “Last Chance to Live”, of course centered around the process of treating obese and overweight people. Dr. Now was among the cast of <a rel=nofollow href=#>two other shows</a> – “Half-Ton Teen” and “World’s Heaviest Men Part II”. Clearly, he is a hard-working individual, but he enjoys helping people in need.</p><h2><span id=Was_he_fired_from_the_show>Was he fired from the show?</span></h2><p>Back in 2012 and 2013, Dr. Nowzaradan it was rumored that he was fired from “My 600-lb Life”, and although quickly dismissed, it seems that they appeared as a result of the fact that the doctor was sued for malpractice. As a matter of fact, Dr. Now and his anesthesiologist have both been sued by Michelle Park, a woman who claimed they left a 6’’piece of tubing inside her body after a surgery, however, the case was dismissed in 2013. Some sources claim that the plaintiff dropped the charges after being paid a hefty sum by the doctor, but Dr. Nowzaradan never confirmed these talks. However, two more patients sued him for malpractice in 2017, but just like the first time – the charges were eventually dropped by the plaintiffs.</p><a rel=nofollow href=# readability=1><p>View this post on Instagram</p></a><p><a rel=nofollow href=#>Televizyon ekranlarına bizleri bağlayan ve hayranlıkla kendini izlettiren, güler güzlü, boynundan steteskopu eksik olmayan, alanında çok başarılı bir doktor olan ve insanların hayatlarını geri kazandıran Doktor&nbsp;Nowzaradan&nbsp;hakkında neler biliyorsunuz? .
