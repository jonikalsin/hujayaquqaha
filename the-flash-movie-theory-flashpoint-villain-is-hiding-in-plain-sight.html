Why is this significant? Well, as established in Flashpoint (and also in <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justice League</a></strong>) Barry’s mother was mysteriously murdered here, and his father was sent to jail for the crime. A crime he says he didn’t commit and also one that Barry doesn’t believe he was responsible for, either. And he’s right, because it was Eobard Thawne, the Reverse-Flash, who had come back from the future to murder the mother of his greatest foe.</p><p>Once Barry realizes that he has the ability to use his speed to travel through time (as we saw at the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">conclusion of <strong>Zack Snyder’s Justice League</strong></a>), he decides to change the past by preventing his mother’s murder. In doing so, he changes the present, and finds himself in a present that is slightly different than the one he is familiar with.</p><p>Now, as far as <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Flash</a> </strong>movie is concerned, it’s not clear if Barry is looking to change the past, or if he’s merely exploring the multiverse in an attempt to reconnect with his mother, as we see in this next shot, which appears to show a tentative Barry sneaking up on an unsuspecting Nora Allen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-16-at-2.33.56-PM.jpg><p>The other possibility (and the one we’ve seen in both the comics and TV versions of <strong>Flashpoint</strong>) is that this is Barry waking up after he has changed the past, and he is surprised to find himself in a reality where his mother is still alive. In any case, we’re not too sure of what’s happening just yet.</p><p>Now, it does appear that just like in the comics, Barry seeks out Bruce Wayne to help him make sense of his bizarre situation. And why wouldn’t he, right? Ben Affleck’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman </a>is a friend and mentor to Barry in the DCEU, so he should go looking for him. Of course, he instead finds Keaton’s older Batman (in the comics he finds Thomas Wayne as Batman, but that’s another story entirely). So does the above image of Barry and his mother take place on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Earth-89</a>, the same world where the Burton Batman movies take place, or is it after Barry has made another multiversal hop?</p><p>I’m going with the former, because of the aforementioned first shot in the footage…</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOrZ%2BeZZahrrS0jKamr6GVYsGpsc6rsGaenJbAqbzOoqWtZaaeua2tyKdkoqtdnbaltc2gZKKmXaW5orXNZqqin5ipfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
