She’ll start taping mid-August and we’ll see her <span>October 2.</span></p><p>On the show, by the time Manning had left Salem, she was known as Dr. Carly Manning Kiriakis Brady Alamain. Her father was Henri Von Leuschner and brother was Frankie Brady. She had a son with Lawrence. Some of you will remember Nicholas Alamain (who once had an affair with Kate Roberts, while she was married to Victor!) who was played by Erik von Detten, from 1992 to 1993, and then by Victor Webster, from 1999 to 2000.</p><p>In real life, Chappell is married to ex-Lawrence Alamain, Michael Sabatino, with whom she met on the show in the 1990s, during her stint as Carly.</p><p>Carly has been on our readers’ minds recently, after witnessing Stephanie being locked up in a body drawer. In the past, Carly was buried alive by Lawrence’s ant, Vivian Alamain! Soaps.com will put out a bio on Carly for those who didn’t watch the show during the 90s, soon. Congrats to Crystal for returning to a character who has been much loved and missed, since Carly left Salem for France in 2000!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmnZmpqHqwsoyorKtlnJ7Dpr%2BOp5ywq19pgnN%2Bjpypsquklrlur8eap6mdnKF6s7HTrqmnq12WwG6vwKujsmWfo3qlrdisZKieXaTCs3nLomY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
